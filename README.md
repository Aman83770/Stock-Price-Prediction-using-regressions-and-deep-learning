# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-regressions-and-deep-learning
Predict Stock price using different regression algorithms like linear regression, support vector regression. We also made deep learning model to predict the future price.

## This project contain two parts. 
Algorithm directory: In which all algorithm has
Website : A web app made on flask framework to showcase our output.
