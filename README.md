## This project contain two parts. 
Algorithm directory: In which all algorithms exist.

Website : A web app made on flask framework to showcase our algorithms output.

## Installation and running the project
1. Go to algorithm directory. Install all dependecies.
2. Generate Twitter API (access toke, consumer key etc.)
3. Generate Quandl API key
4. Run all algorithms using command python file_name.py
